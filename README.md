This project simulates a basic weather model using the quadratic equation ax² + bx + c = 0. It is built in 4 stages and uploaded for version control and demonstration.
- stage1_hardcoded.py – Solves the equation using fixed values
- stage2_keyboard_input.py – Takes input from the user
- stage3_file_input_single.py – Reads one equation from input.txt
- stage4_file_input_multiple.py – Solves multiple equations from file
- input.txt – Input data for stage 3 and 4
- HOW TO RUN ?
- To run any of the Python programs:

1. Open the **Command Prompt (cmd)** on your computer.
   - Press Windows + R, type cmd, and press Enter.

2. Navigate to the folder where your files are saved.
   - Use the cd command. For example, if your files are in C:\Users\YourName\weather_model, type:
     
     cd C:\Users\YourName\weather_model
     

3. Run the program by typing:
python filename.py
Replace filename.py with the program you want to run.

To run the keyboard input program, type:
python stage2_keyboard_input.py

To run the program that reads multiple inputs from a file, type:
python stage4_file_input_multiple.py

Make sure input.txt is in the same folder for the file reading programs.
